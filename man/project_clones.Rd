\title{Calculate clone projection}
\usage{
project_clones(
  count_data,
  count_column,
  grouping_col = NA,
  project_amnt = c(10000)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{count_data}{A data.table containing clone barcode count data.}

\item{count_column}{A character string specifying the column storing clone barcode counts.}

\item{grouping_col}{A character string, default NA. If provided, the projection
is repeated for each group defined by this column.}

\item{project_amnt}{A vector of numeric indicating the number of cells to project to.}
}
\value{
A modified data.table with projected cell counts.
}
\description{
Predicts the number of cells tagged with each clone barcode for a given projection amount.
This function is useful for planning single-cell experiments.
It allows you to estimate the number of cells associated with specific clone barcodes
and anticipate the abundance of clone barcodes (i.e., how many clone barcodes
with a substantial number of cells).
}
\details{
How this projection is done: For each clone barcode, we compute their proportion,
and then multiply the proportion by the number of cells to project to
(specified by the `project_amnt` parameter).
If `grouping_col` is specified, the proportion will be calculated with respect
to the total number of cells in each group.


The parameter `project_amnt` allows you to specify the desired number of cells
for projection.
You can provide a numeric vector containing one or more values, indicating the
number of cells you want to project your data onto.
For example, if you want to project to 10,000 and 20,000 cells,
you can create a vector `c(10000, 20000)` and pass it as the value for `project_amnt`.
